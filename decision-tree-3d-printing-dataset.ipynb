Where my duty was to help the students to fabricate their mechatronics projects by using 3D printer, LASER Cutter and CNC milling machine. I used CURA Ultimaker most of the time until the PRUSA arrived. So, when I discovered this dataset, I found that the labels and features deal with the filaments(ABS, PLA), Fan speed, Temparture, infill and so on. I could literallty visualize what the dataset is trying to say. So, I couldn't resist my temptation to play with it. The dataset is small but infront of my will it is big enough!\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Aniruddha120/Aniruddha120/assets/34673269/5e3b2165-729b-4a76-abdd-84c7e8cb2f17\" /></div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Previous Investigation\n\nI found that a [Kaggler used linear regreesion](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashishpaul17/linear-regression-study-on-the-3d-printing-dataset) to predicit certain features and the accuracy was good.
